# ShoppingApp
The Breeze Shopping App utilizes the FakeStoreAPI in order to fetch a selection of clothes along with important information such as their price and rating. This allows the user to look through the items, add the ones they like, and checkout! The purpose of building this project was to expand my React.js knowledge, utilizing tools I was unfamiliar with such as the React Router for adding multiple routes to my page, external libraries such as React-Spinners for showing loading progress to the user, and the Outlet Context API to pass information throughout components without prop drilling.
